## Hey There!
My name is **Roberto Baiochi** and I am a software developer specializing in web development.

:round_pushpin: ~ I am currently living in Brazil and looking for new work opportunities.

:mortar_board: ~ I'm studying Systems Analysis and Development and working as a Frontend developer. 

:computer: ~ I have a variety of technical skills, including using technologies and programming languages such as:
  - JavaScript / NodeJS / TypeScript.
  - ReactJs / NextJs / React-Native.
  - HTML / CSS.
  - Developing and consuming APIs.

Although it's not my specialty, but I've written a few lines of code in Python, C/C++ and PHP.
